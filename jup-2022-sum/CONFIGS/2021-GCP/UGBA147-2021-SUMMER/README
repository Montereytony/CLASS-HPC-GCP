First run init_ugba147-2021-summer.sh

This creates the name space and initializes jupyterhub. This will give us the public IP that
google assignes. You will notice that we do not mount any storage with this yaml file.

Next run  kubectl --namespace=ugba147-2021-summer get svc proxy-public  to get the external address.

Now with the IP address,  go to aws and update route53 with the name/ip

With the name and IP created, now we can update the update yaml file so the SSL cert
can be created.

Also now that the name/ip is configured go to the console and update the Oauth credentials for the
domain. Basically copy the secret and the key and add it to the config yaml file.

ince we have the name space created, lets create the pv/pvc for the home folder and for the shared folder.
