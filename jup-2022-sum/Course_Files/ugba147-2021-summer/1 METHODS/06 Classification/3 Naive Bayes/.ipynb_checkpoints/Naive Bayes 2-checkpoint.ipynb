    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the prosecutor\\'s fallacy.  There is a criminal trial in progress, and the prosecutor tells the jury that the defendant\\'s DNA was found at the crime scene, proving he was there.  This along with some other evidence, says the prosecutor, is enough to prove that the defendant did commit the crime.  In fact, someone\\'s DNA was found at the crime, and it could be the defendant\\'s according to a DNA expert who testifies that there is only a one in a million chance that the DNA could be from someone else.  Even so, the prosecutor insists, that means there is a 99.99999% chance that the DNA is from the defendant, which is so overwhelmingly conclusive that any reasonable person would agree the DNA must be from the defendant.  The prosecutor presses the jury for a conviction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the DNA really from the defendant?  We have already established that there is a one in a million chance that it is from someone else.  Is that a lot?  How many other people could the DNA be from?  There are more than seven billion people in the world.  So, notwithstanding other information to the contrary, the DNA could be from any of 7,000 people.  That means that the probability that the DNA is from the defendant is really 1 $\\div$ 7000 = 0.014%, which is almost negligible.  The DNA evidence by itself indicates that the defendant is extremely unlikely to be the culprit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with prosecutor\\'s reasoning is that it did not take into account what we call the prior probability; that is, the probability of something happening considered before we look at the conditional probability of that something happening in a specific case.  (The prosecutor\\'s fallacy has shown up in several famous real criminal trials, resulting in unfortunate incorrect convictions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive Bayes method makes explicit use of conditional probabilities that something could happen and the prior probability that that something could happen.  It constructs models that make predictions taking both into account."

    "## Lesson Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first see how naive Bayes works using data with one numeric predictor variable and a class variable.  Then with one categoric predictor variable and a class variable.  Then with multiple predictor variables.  After that, we\\'ll look at a simplified version of naive Bayes (Gaussian probability density estimate) and an enhanced version of naive Bayes (LaPlace smoothing)."

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some new terms we will use in our discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **likelihood** is a score that measures how conditionally likely something is to happen.  One way to measure this is by the conditional probability that that something is to happen.  This way is appropriate if the something that is to happen can be described with a categoric variable.  Another way to measure likelihood is by the conditional probability density that that something is to happen.  This way is appropriate if the something that is to happen can be described with a numeric variable. So, a particular likelihood must be either a conditional probability or a conditional probability density. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **prior probability** is what happened before considering a condition.  You can think of it as a sort of background setting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **posterior score** is the product of some likelihoods and a prior probability.  Note that a posterior score potentially folds probabilities and probability densities into a single number.  That is okay.  We are not interested in reconciling units or in dissecting which part of the single number comes from probabilities vs. probability densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **relative posterior score** is posterior score scaled so that all posterior scores sum to one."

Most of the observations classified as B are at x1 greater or equal to 14.    Also, there are five observations classified as A and six observations classified as B.

For observations classified as B, the probability density around x1=10 (0.0344) is not so high as for those classified as A, so this quantifies the assertion that finding a new observation classified as B in this vicinity is less likely.  Chances are that a new observation in this vicinity should be classified as A rather than B.  Note that to reach this conclusion, we needed two likelihoods, one for each class."

Recall that there are five observations classified as A and six observations classified as B.  Accordingly, we may want to classify the new observation as B to match what we see in the background, regardless of its x1 value.  This also seems like a reasonable option, though many (or most) people use this approach seldomly when making their own decisions.  It incorporates the notion of prior probability."

    "### Prediction by Relative Posterior Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the two options.  Each has its merits.  But rather than debate which option is better, we can instead take both likelihood and prior probability into account when classifying a new observation.  To do that, we still need to classify based on single metrics for each class, but those metrics must incorporate information about the likelihoods and prior probabilities.  You may be able to think of several different ways to combine likelihoods and prior probabilities.  One way is to simply multiply them together to get what we call the posterior score, which aligns with our intuition about how such a metric should behave.  If the likelihood is a large number, that will drive the posterior score to be large, which is what we want.  If the prior probability is a large number, that will drive the posterior score to be large, which is what we want.  The posterior score is easy to calculate and compared to other approaches simplifies some upcoming math.  The relative posterior score is the posterior score scaled so that all posterior scores sum to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s see how taking the relative posterior score into account would play out.  We already have two likelihoods, one for each class.  And we already have two prior probabilities, one for each class.  Multiply the likelihood and prior probability for class A together.  Multiply the likelihood and prior probability for class B together.  That produces two posterior scores.  Each could potentially range from zero to approaching infinity.  The posterior score for our new observation classified as A is 0.0650.  The posterior score for our new observation classified as B is 0.01873.  "

Treat the relative posterior score for a class as the probability that a new observation should be classified as that class.  Then compare the probability to the cutoff.  If it exceeds that threshold, classify the new observation as the appropriate class accordingly.  The relative posterior score for our new observation classified as A is 77.63%.  So, according to the model generated by the naive Bayes method, the probability that the new observation is classified as A is 77.63%.  That is larger than a cutoff of, say, 50%, so the new observation should be classified as A.  "

    "To recap:  The naive Bayes method builds a model specified by the way likelihoods are to be calculated and some prior probabilities, all inferred from some reference classified data.  Likelihoods are calculated from a set of specific probability density functions if the predictor variable is numeric, or from a specific relative frequency table if the predictor variable is categoric.  There are separate likelihood calculators for each class.  There are separate prior probabilities for each class.  Given such a model, you can classify a new observation by calculating the probability of it being classified one way or the other, and comparing that probability to a cutoff that you set ahead of time.  The formula for the probability of a new observation being classified as A is this: multiply the likelihood of the new observation being classified as A by the prior probability of it being classified as A, scale this number to get the relative posterior score, and treat the relative posterior score as the probability."

    "Consider the pedagogical dataset comprising 11 observations.  Each observation has an x1 value, an x2 value, and is classified as either A or B.  In this data, both x1 and x2 happen to be numeric.  Consider also a new unclassified observation at x1=10 and x2=4.  A two-dimensional scatterplot of x2 values versus x1 values color-coded by class exposes some patterns.  The observations classified as A have relatively low x1 and x2 values, so they appear in the lower left part of the plot.  The observations classified as B have relatively high x1 and x2 values, so they appear in the upper right part of the plot.  Observations classified as A and observations classified as B both appear in the middle of the plot.  Also, there are five observations classified as A and six observations classified as B.  The new observation at x1=10 and x2=4 is shown in gray to emphasize that we do not know its class. Should the new observation be classified as A or B?"

    "Taking into account likelihoods only, perhaps you would reason that the new observation should be classified as A because it appears within a concentration of other observations classified as A, arranged along a diagonal.  In contrast, the new observation is just outside the concentration of other observations classified as B, arranged along a diagonal.  Taking into account prior probabilities only, perhaps you would reason that the new observation should be classified as B because there are more observations classified as B than there are observations classified as A.  Taking into account both likelihood and prior probabilities, you could combine their magnitudes somehow.  To do this when there is more than one predictor variable, we need to adjust how we calculate likelihoods and adjust how we combine likelihood and prior probability."

    "### Calculate Likelihoods\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to adjust the likelihood calculation, which is not what the naive Bayes method does, would be to find multi-variate probability density functions and use those as measures of likelihood.  Those would effectively be probability density contours or hyper-contours that account for many variables.  Recall that there are versions of the kernel density estimation method that do account for many variables.  This approach would be computationally intensive and mathematically complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler way to adjust the likelihood calculation, which is what the naive Bayes method does, is to find separate probability density functions for each variable.  That is a one-variable probability density function for each class for each variable.  This approach does not account for any interaction there might be between variables, which we will just accept as not necessary to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s see how finding separate probability functions for each predictor variable would play out.  Partition the data by class, which effectively conditions our next steps on class.  For each variable, x1 and x2, build two probability density functions, one for each partition.  Recall that you can use the kernel density estimation method to build probability density functions.  The probability densities can range from zero to approaching infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-dimensional scatterplot of x1 values color-coded by class overlaid onto plots of the two probability density functions exposes some patterns.  For observations classified as A, the high probability density around x1=10 (0.1431) quantifies the assertion that finding a new observation classified as A in this vicinity is likely.  For observations classified as B, the probability density around x1=10 (0.0344) is not so high as for those classified as A, so this quantifies the assertion that finding a new observation classified as B in this vicinity is less likely."

For observations classified as B, the probability density around x2=4 (0.0403) is much lower, so this quantifies the assertion that finding a new observation classified as B in this vicinity is less likely."

    "Now, we want the posterior scores to account for all the likelihoods and the prior probabilities.  Each class is associated with not one but two likelihoods, one for x1 and one for x2.  When we worked with one predictor variable, we calculated the posterior score for each class as the product of the likelihood and the prior probability.  With more than one predictor variable, we can calculate the posterior score as the product of all the likelihoods and the prior probability.  The posterior score for an observation classified as A at x1=10 and x2=4 is 0.009304 (0.1431 $\\times$ 0.1431 $\\times$ 0.4545).  The posterior score for an observation classified as B at x1=10 and x2=4 is 0.000754 (0.0344 $\\times$ 0.0403 $\\times$ 0.5454).  The posterior scores sum to 0.0100 (0.009304 + 0.000754)."

    "See that the posterior score calculated as the product of more than one likelihood and a prior probability aligns with our intuition about how such a metric should behave.  If any of the likelihoods is a large number, that will drive the posterior score to be large, which is what we want.  If the prior probability is a large number, that will drive the posterior score to be large, which is what we want.  If some of the factors are large and some are small, then there is a competition for which factors overwhelm the others, which is what we want.  You may still be concerned that the likelihoods could be extremely large while the prior probabilities will always be less than one, so that the prior probability\\'s contribution to the posterior scores will too often get overwhelmed.  But this will not be a problem for us because ultimately we are concerned only with the relative magnitudes of the posterior scores.  Whatever contribution the prior probabilities make to the relative posterior scores will be on the same order of magnitude for both classes.\n",

    "You can generalize this approach to handle more than two predictor variables and handle any combination of numeric and categoric predictor variables.  Calculate as many sets of likelihoods as there are predictor variables, using probability density functions for numeric variables and relative frequency tables for categoric variables.  Calculate posterior scores for each class as the products of all likelihoods and prior probabilities for that class.  Scale the posterior scores to relative posterior scores and treat those as the probabilities that a new observation should be classified as A or B."

    "Let\\'s see how using Gaussian functions to find likelihoods would play out.  Partition the data by class, which effectively conditions our next steps on class.  Build two Gaussian functions, one for each partition.  Recall that a Gaussian function is defined by a mean and a standard deviation.  So, to build the Gaussian function for class A, find the mean and stand deviation of x1 values for observations classified as A.  The mean is 7.60 and the standard deviation is 3.86.  Similarly, to build the Gaussian function for class B, find the mean and standard deviation of x1 values for observations classified as B.  The mean is 14.74 and the standard deviation is 3.12.  A one-dimensional scatterplot of x1 values color-coded by class overlaid onto plots of the two Gaussian functions exposes some patterns."

Depending on your perspective, you can think of it as a sophisticated improvement to the method or as a hack of last resort to keep the method from breaking.  Either way, LaPlace smoothing is quite useful."

    "### Why It\\'s Called LaPlace Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief digression here on why we name this enhancement after LaPlace, an eighteenth-century polymath.  LaPlace preceded data science and the naive Bayes method, but he introduced us to the Sunrise Problem.  What is the probability that the sun will not rise tomorrow?  Based on historical observations about which days the sun did or did not rise, the probability that the sun will not rise tomorrow could be calculated to be 0%.  This because every historical observation shows the sun rising on some day, and no observation shows the sun not rising on some day.  But it just did not feel right that the probability is really zero merely because we have never seen anything to the contrary.  LaPlace proposed instead to imagine that you have one (or a few) extra observation that shows the sun not rising on some day.  With one real observation and the imagined extra observation, the probability is 50% that the sun will not rise (1 day when the sun did not rise $\\div$ 2 days total).  With two real observations the probability is 33%.  With three real observations the probability is 25%.  With many real observations the probability is very small, but never exactly zero.  There is always at least a little room left for the possibility that sun will not rise tomorrow.  The naive Bayes method enhanced by LaPlace smoothing harkens back to the Sunrise Problem. "

Under that assumption, the conditional probability of variable values given a class reduces to the product of the conditional probabilities of one variable value at a time given a class.  Those we know how to calculate.  They are the likelihoods.  So, we have dealt with how to do that calculation.  But pause: you may initially be uncomfortable with the assumption about variable independence.  After all, how often do you get data in the real world where the variables are all independent of each other?  Almost never.  Or perhaps never ever.  But this is still acceptable because it is not our goal to faithfully represent the reference data in a Bayes rule-compliant statistical model.  Rather our goal is to generate a model that performs well at classifying new observations.  It turns out that in practice models built on the assumption of variable independence do often perform well at classifying new observations.  The assumption of variable independence is why the method is not called the Bayes method, but rather is called the naive Bayes method.  We naively assume variable independence.\n",
