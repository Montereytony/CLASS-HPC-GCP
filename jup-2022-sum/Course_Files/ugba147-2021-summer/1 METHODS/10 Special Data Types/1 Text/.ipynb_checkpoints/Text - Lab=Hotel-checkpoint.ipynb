You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!                            </td><td>Very nice hotel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>A Traveler                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",

staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!                             & Very nice hotel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & A Traveler                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful.
