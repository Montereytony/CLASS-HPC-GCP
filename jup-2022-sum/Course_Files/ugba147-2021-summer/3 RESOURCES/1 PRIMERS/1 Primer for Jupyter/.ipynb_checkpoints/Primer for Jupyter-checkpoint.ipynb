    "\n",
    "Headings, discussion of the analysis, and/or discussion of R code is kept in white **text cells**.  You can select any text cell, directly edit its text (use double-click to enter edit mode), and/or refresh its formatting (use cntl-Enter).\n",

    "R code is kept in gray **code cells**.  You can select any code cell (position the cursor anywhere within the cell and left-click), directly edit its R code, and execute its R code (press cntl-Enter).  Any output will be presented immediately below the corresponding code cell.  While code within a cell is executing, the status indicator at the upper-left of the cell shows `In: [*]`.  When code is finished executing, the status indicator changes to show a number, like `In: [26]`.  The number tracks how many times code in the cell has been executed. \n",

    "You can also execute all R code across all cells in one step (use Kernel > Restart & Run All from the menu bar).\n",
