    "* **Objective:** Conduct an exploratory data analysis of a dataset about public company fundamentals.\n",
    "* **Approach:**  Retrieve a public company fundamentals dataset comprising thousands of US companies from quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of year 2017 + company stock price data for those companies from quarter 4 of year 2018.  Transform the dataset representation to capture all information about any single company in a single observation.  Apply various descriptive statistics, data visualizations (including kernel density estimates), and cross-tabulations to look for interesting patterns and inter-company relationships.\n",

    "### Build & Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Objective:**  Construct and tune several classifiers and/or regressors, each trained on a transformed dataset about public company fundamentals.\n",
    "* **Approach:**  Construct models to predict stock performance, given 12 months of past company fundamentals data, and using a machine learning model construction methods and transformed data.  Tune the models by systematically selecting various combinations of predictor variables and cutoffs, and identify the best business performance based on a business model and business parameters.  Select the method that produces the best performing model as measured by cross-validation, and build a new model using that method based on all the orginal data. \n",

    "* **Approach:** Retrieve an investment opportunities dataset, comprising fundamentals for some set of public companies over some one-year period.  Transform the representation of the investment opportunities to match the representation expected by the model, leveraging previous analysis.  Use the model to make predictions about the investment opportunities and accordingly recommend a portfolio of 12 company investments."
